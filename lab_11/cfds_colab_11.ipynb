Finally, we will inspect the low-dimensional representations of each journal entry to interpret the detection results.\n",

Traditionally \"red-flag\" tests performed by auditors during annual audits are designed to capture those types of anomalies.

As a result, such anomalies usually pose a high fraud risk since they might correspond to, e.g., misused user accounts, irregular combinations of general ledger accounts and posting keys that don't follow a usual activity pattern."

    "Unfortunately, neural networks are, in general, not designed to be trained directly on categorical data and require the attributes to be trained on to be numeric. One simple way to meet this requirement is by applying a technique referred to as **\"one-hot\" encoding**. Using this encoding technique, we will derive a numerical representation of each of the categorical attribute values. One-hot encoding creates new binary columns for each categorical attribute value present in the original data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at the example shown in **Figure 2** below. The **categorical attribute “Receiver”** below contains the names \"John,\" \"Timur\" and \"Marco.\" We \"one-hot\" encode the names by creating a separate binary column for each possible name-value observable in the \"Receiver\" column. Now, we encode for each transaction that contains the value \"John\" in the \"Receiver\" column this observation with 1.0 in the newly created \"John\" column and 0.0 in all other generated name columns."

    "AENNs or \"Replicator Neural Networks\" is a variant of general feed-forward neural networks that have been initially introduced by Hinton and Salakhutdinov in [6]. AENNs usually comprise a **symmetrical network architecture** as well as a central hidden layer, referred to as **\"latent\"** or **\"coding\" layer**, of lower dimensionality. The design is chosen intentionally since the training objective of an AENN is to reconstruct its input in an \"unsupervised\" training setup. **Figure 3** below illustrates a schematic view of an autoencoder neural network:"

    "Furthermore, AENNs can be interpreted as \"lossy\" data **compression algorithms**. They are \"lossy\" in a sense that the reconstructed outputs will be degraded compared to the original inputs. The difference between the original input $x^i$ and its reconstruction $\\hat{x}^i$ is referred to as **reconstruction error**. In general, AENNs encompass three major building blocks:\n",

The encoder mapping $f_\\theta(\\cdot)$ maps an input vector (e.g. an \"one-hot\" encoded transaction) $x^i$ to a compressed representation $z^i$ referred to as latent space $Z$. This hidden representation $z^i$ is then mapped back by the decoder $g_\\theta(\\cdot)$ to a re-constructed vector $\\hat{x}^i$ of the original input space (e.g. the re-constructed encoded transaction). Formally, the nonlinear mappings of the encoder- and the decoder-function can be defined by:"

For the encoder, we aim to implement a network consisting of **nine fully-connected layers**. Furthermore, the encoder is specified by the following number of neurons per layer: \"384-256-128-64-32-16-8-4-3\". Meaning the first layer consists of 384 neurons (determined by the dimensionality of our input data), the second layer of 256 neurons and the subsequent layers of 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4 and 3 neurons respectively."

Leaky ReLUs allow a small gradient even when a particular neuron is not active. Besides, we include the **\"drop-out\" probability**, as introduced by [8], which defines the probability rate for each neuron to be set to zero at a forward pass to prevent the network from overfitting. However, we explore its effect on the model later in the exercise section of the lab. Initially, we set the dropout probability of each neuron to $p=0.0$ (0%), meaning that none of the neuron activations will be set to zero."

This observation indicates that the model already did an excellent job in learning the distinct attribute pattern of the journal entries.

Ultimately, train an `AENN model` including both attributes and evaluate its anomaly detection performance."
