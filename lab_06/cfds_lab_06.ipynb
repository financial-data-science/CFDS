This holds for instances when the training data is not linearly separable. Boser, Guyon and Vapnik [7] showed the so-called **\"kernel trick\"** (introduced by Aizermann[8]) could be used to accomplish this in a surprisingly straightforward way. First notice again, from the training objectives dual formulation, that the only way in which the data appears in the objective is in the form of dot products $<x_{i}, x_{j}>$. Now suppose we first mapped the data to some other (possibly infinite-dimensional) Euclidean space $\\mathcal{H}$, using the mapping which we will call $\\phi$:"
