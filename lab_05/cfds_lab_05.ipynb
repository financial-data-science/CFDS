We assume that the first feature $x_{1}$ represents the \"sepal length\" observations of the Iris Dataset, the second feature $x_{2}$ = \"sepal width\", $x_{3}$ = \"petal length\", and $x_{4}$ = \"petal width\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the evidence $P(x)$ of a particular observation, e.g, $x=\\{x_{1}=7.8, x_{2}=2.3, x_{3}=6.4, x_{4}=2.5\\}$ the Bayes' theorem in general utilizes the following two tricks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trick 1: \"Conditional Independence\"** \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the **\"Chain Rule of Probabilities\"**, we can express the evidence term $P( \\mathbf{x} )$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P( \\mathbf{x}) = P(\\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}) = P(x_1) \\cdot P(x_2 | x_1) \\cdot P(x_3 | x_1, x_2) \\cdot P(x_4 | x_1, x_2, x_3) \\cdot ... \\cdot P( x_n | x_1, ..., x_{n-1}) = \\prod^n_i P(x_i | x_{1:i-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By itself, this expression doesn't get us any further. We still need, even in a case of $d$ binary features, to estimate roughly $2^d$ parameters. The trick of the **naive** Bayes' theorem however is to assume that the distinct features $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are **conditionally independent** from each other when observing a particular class $c$. Using this assumption we're in much better shape, as the evidence term $P(\\mathbf{x})$ simplifies to: \n",

    "\n",
    "Estimating each evidence term $\\prod^n_i P(x_i)$ amounts to estimating the distribution of each feature $x_i$ independently. As a result, the assumption of conditional independence reduced the complexity of our model (in terms of the number of parameters) from an exponentially growing dependence in the number of features to a linear growing dependence. Hence, we call it the **\"naive\"** Bayes' theorem, since it makes the naive assumption about feature independence, so we don't have to care about dependencies among them.\n",
