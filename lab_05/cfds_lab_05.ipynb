    "The **Expectation Maximization (EM)** algorithm technique is similar to the k-Means Clustering technique.

The goal of the clustering algorithm then is to maximize the overall probability or likelihood of the data, given the (final) clusters. Thereby, the objective of EM clustering is to estimate the means and standard deviations for each cluster so as to maximize the likelihood of the observed data (distribution). To achieve this objective the algorithm iteratively computes an (1) Expectation-Step and (2) Maximization-Step as described in the following:"
